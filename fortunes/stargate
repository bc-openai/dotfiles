  My Uncle George, he always hated the phrase "save the planet"... the planet's going to be here no matter what happens.
  It might be a giant unlivable rock, but it's going to survive... [it] isn't about saving the planet. It's about saving
  lives.

  With all due respect, sir, you and I both know the people who made the rules were not prepared for anything like this.

Dr. Jackson: This tastes like chicken.
Capt. Carter: So what's wrong with it?
Dr. Jackson: It's macaroni and cheese.

[Teal'c tests a friendly alarm by tossing a rock into it]
Col. O'Neill: Perfect. If any little rocks sneak up on us, we'll have plenty of warning.
%
Col. O'Neill: Whole boxes of material could be missing.
Dr. Jackson: No, the Pentagon said this was everything.
Col. O'Neill: Oh, please. The Pentagon's lost entire countries.

Teal'c: If we are caught, you will be brought before Apophis along with us.
Col. O'Neill: We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Bra'tac: No. The bridge is too well guarded.
%
Capt. Carter: Daniel, it's not that we don't believe you...
Dr. Jackson: So you do?
Col. O'Neill: No. It's just that we don't believe you.

  Now, I suppose this is the time for me to say something profound... Nothing comes to mind, let's do it.

Col. O'Neill

Bra'tac: We offer to lay down our lives for your world, human. You cannot ask more.
Col. O'Neill: No, I can't. But I think a better idea is to get the other guys to lay down their lives for their world
first.
%
Col. O'Neill: I think what the Captain's asking is, "What do we do now?"
Bra'tac: Now we die.
Col. O'Neill: Well, that's a bad plan.
%
  Teal'c, look scary and take point.

Col. O'Neill

Capt. Carter: Wait. Didn't that seem just a little too easy?
Col. O'Neill: Yes, it did. Let's go home.

  You know, I can navigate my way across the galaxy, but I get lost every time I come to Washington.

Jack O'Neill: Oh, yeah. Yeah. We're pulling some major gees now.
Colonel Cromwell: I feel like I put on a couple hundred pounds.
Jack O'Neill: I wasn't going to say anything.
%
Maj. Thornbird: Our cameras saw some sort of weapon.
Col. O'Neill: Oh. Well, it's hard to say.
Maj. Thornbird: Some sort of state secret?
Col. O'Neill: No, just difficult to pronounce.
%
Dr. Jackson: Uh, the second Goa'uld representative we're expecting is Yu.
Col. O'Neill: Me?
%
Dr. Jackson: What just happened?
Col. O'Neill: Apparently we said hello, insulted each other, and broke for recess.
%
Teal'c: He is concealing something.
Col. O'Neill: Like what?
Teal'c: I am unsure. He is concealing it.
%
Anise: Your strength is five times that of a normal human.
Col. O'Neill: So, no increase then.
%
Jack O'Neill: As soon as I get the gate open, head straight for it. Don't bring anything with you.
Dr. Hamilton: No! We can't leave behind weeks of research!
Jack O'Neill: Carter, if he so much as brings a file folder, shoot him!
Maj. Carter: Yes, Sir.
%
Col. O'Neill: Something wrong?
Maj. Carter: No. I've just never blown up a star before.
Col. O'Neill: Well, they say the first one's always the hardest.
%
  I have great confidence in you, Carter. Go on back to the SGC and... confuse Hammond.

Col. O'Neill

Maj. Carter: Is there any chance you can get the Russians to give us their DHD?
Dr. Jackson: Not without giving back Alaska.
%
Col. O'Neill: It's time for Plan B.
Maj. Carter: We have a Plan B?
Col. O'Neill: No, but it's time for one.
