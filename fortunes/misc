Tim Taylor: What're you doing?
Wilson: Just carving out a canoe, Tim.

I am not a visionary.

I do not have a five-year plan.

I'm an engineer.

And I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and staring at the clouds and looking at the
stars and saying "I want to go there!". But I'm looking at the ground. And I want to fix the pothole that's right
in front of me before I fall in.

There's the argument that if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear. But laws and governments change, and
the internet is global. If you allow a backdoor here, you're also allowing it for another country's government to spy
on its opponents, and another to spy on people that they suspect might be gay, or who use marijuana, or who are
Christian.

In 50 years, maybe you'll be part of a country where eating meat has been outlawed and the government will want to
come afer you for tracking down the illegal bacon trading ring that your friends are part of.

"Nothing to hide" only works if the folks in power share the values of you and everyone you know entirely and always
will.
