The Doctor: The Doctor. Doctor. Fun.

  Nice to meet you Rose. Run for your life!

The Doctor: Go to your room. Go to your room! I mean it. I'm very, very angry
            with you. I'm very, very cross! Go to your room!

[Gas-masked people walk away.]

The Doctor: I'm really glad that worked. Those would have been terrible last
            words.
%
  Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me!
  Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger.

  People assume that time is a strict progression of cause to effect. But actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective
  viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff.

The Doctor
%
  This is my timey-wimey detector. Goes "bing" when there's stuff. Also, it can boil an egg at 30 paces. Whether you
  want it to or not, actually, so I've learnt to stay away from hens. It's not pretty when they blow.

The Doctor
%
  They're coming. The Angels are coming for you, but listen -- your life could depend on this -- don't blink. Don't even
  blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast; faster than you could believe. Don't turn your back, don't look away, and
  don't blink. Good luck.

The Doctor
%
  You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up "genocide". You'll find a little picture of me
  there, and the caption'll read "Over my dead body".

The Doctor: Everyone has nightmares. Even monsters from under the bed have nightmares.
Reinette: What do monsters have nightmares about?
The Doctor: Me.
%
Mickey: What's a horse doing on a spaceship?
The Doctor: Mickey, what's pre-revolutionary France doing on a spaceship? Get a little perspective!
%
[Mickey is holding down a button on the TARDIS console]
The Doctor: Umm... what are you doing that for?
Mickey: 'Cause you told me to.
The Doctor: When was that?
Mickey: About half an hour ago.
The Doctor: Umm... you can let go now.
Mickey: How long has it been since I could've stopped?
The Doctor: Ten minutes? Twenty? ...Twenty-nine?

Cyber Leader: Daleks, be warned. You have declared war upon the Cybermen.
Dalek Sec: This is not war. This is pest control!
Cyber Leader: We have five million Cybermen. How many are you?
Dalek Sec: Four.
Cyber Leader: You would destroy the Cybermen with four Daleks?
Dalek Sec: We would destroy the Cybermen with one Dalek! You are superior in only one respect.
Cyber Leader: What is that?
Dalek Sec: You are better at dying.
%
The Doctor: Course you're not, you're not scared of anything! Box falls out of the sky, man falls out of box, man eats
fish custard, and look at you! Just... sitting there. So you know what I think?
Amelia: What?
The Doctor: Must be a hell of a scary crack in your wall.
%
The Doctor: And what sort of job's a kissogram?
Amy Pond: I go to parties and I... kiss people... with outfits. It's a laugh!
The Doctor: You were a little girl five minutes ago!
Amy Pond: You're worse than my aunt!
The Doctor: I'm the Doctor! I'm worse than everybody's aunt!
%
Amelia: Don't have a mum and dad. Just an aunt.
The Doctor: I don't even have an aunt.
Amelia: You're lucky.
The Doctor: I know.

Atraxi: You are not of this world.
The Doctor: No, but I've put a lot of work into it.
%
Atraxi: Is this world important?
The Doctor: "Important?" What's that mean, "important?" Six billion people live here; is that important?
%
The Doctor: Is this world a threat to the Atraxi? ...Come on, you're monitoring the whole planet. Is this world a
threat?
Atraxi: No.
The Doctor: Are the peoples of this world guilty of any crime by the laws of the Atraxi?
Atraxi: No.
The Doctor: Okay! One more, just one. Is this world ...protected?
[The Atraxi scans through pictures of Cybermen, Daleks, Racnoss, Sea Devils,
 Slitheen, etc.]
The Doctor: You're not the first lot to have come here. Oh, there have been so many. And what you've got to ask is: what
happened to them?
[The Atraxi scans through pictures of the previous incarnations of the Doctor, ending with an image of the Tenth Doctor
that the current Doctor steps through]
The Doctor: Hello. I'm the Doctor. Basically, run.
%
The Doctor: Coming?
Amy Pond: No.
The Doctor: You wanted to come fourteen years ago.
Amy Pond: I grew up.
The Doctor: Don't worry, I'll soon fix that.
%
Amy: You look human...
The Doctor: No, you look Time Lord.
%
Amy: How does a mouth have an eject button?!
The Doctor: Think about it! Right, then! This isn't going to be big on dignity!
%
The Doctor: Didn't anyone ever tell you? There's one thing you never put in a trap -- if you're smart, if you value your
continued existence, if you have any plans about seeing tomorrow -- there's one thing you never, ever, put in a trap.
Angel Bob: And what would that be, sir?
The Doctor: Me.

Amy Pond: What if the gravity fails?
The Doctor: I've thought about that.
Amy Pond: And?
The Doctor: We'll all plunge to our deaths. See? I've thought about it!

Father Octavian: Dr. Song, I've lost good Clerics today. Do you trust this man?
River Song: I absolutely trust him.
Father Octavian: He's not some kind of madman?
River Song: ...I absolutely trust him.
%
  Father Octavian, when the Doctor's in the room, your one and only 'mission' is to keep him alive long enough to get
  everyone else home. And trust me, it's not easy.

River Song
%
The Doctor: Can I trust you, River Song?
River Song: If you like. But where's the fun in that?
%
The Doctor: It's a lot to take in, isn't it? Tiny box, huge room inside; what's that about? Let me explain...
Rory: It's another dimension.
The Doctor: It's basically another dimen-- what?
Rory: After what happened with Prisoner Zero, I've been reading up on all the latest scientific theories. FTL travel,
parallel universes.
The Doctor: I like the bit when someone says "It's bigger on the inside!" I always look forward to that.
%
Amy: Shall I run and get the manual?
The Doctor: I threw it in a supernova.
Amy: You threw the manual in a supernova? Why?
The Doctor: Because I disagreed with it!
%
The Dream Lord: If you die in the dream, you wake up in reality. Healthy recovery in next to no time. Ask me what
happens if you die in reality.
Rory: What happens?
The Dream Lord: You die, stupid. That's why it's called "reality".
%
  One reality was always too much for you, Doctor. Take two, and call me in the morning.

Tony Mack: You're not making any sense, man.
The Doctor: Excuse me, I'm making perfect sense. You're just not keeping up.
%
Elliot: Have you met monsters before?
The Doctor: Yeah.
Elliot: You scared of them?
The Doctor: No. They're scared of me.
%
The Doctor: How many are you?
Alaya: I'm the last of my species.
The Doctor: Really? No. "Last of the species", the Klempari Defence. As an interrogation defence, it's a bit old hat,
I'm afraid.
Alaya: I'm the last of my species.
The Doctor: No. You're really not. Because I'm the last of my species and I know how it sits in a heart. So don't insult
me.
%
  Is this how time normally passes? Really slowly... in the right order?

The Doctor
%
  There was... a nameless, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the
  cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear
  down your world.

The Doctor
%
  Now the question of the hour is, 'Who's got the Pandorica?' Answer: I do. Next question: Who's coming to take it from
  me? Come on! Look at me! No plan, no back-up, no weapons worth a damn! Oh, and something else: I don't have Anything.
  To. Lose. So, if you're sitting up there in your silly little spaceships, with all your silly little guns, and you've
  got any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight, just remember who's standing in your way!  Remember every black day I
  ever stopped you! And then, AND THEN... do the smart thing: Let somebody else try first.

The Doctor
%
  The universe is big, it's vast and complicated, and ridiculous. And sometimes, very rarely, impossible things just
  happen and we call them miracles. And that's the theory. Nine hundred years, never seen one yet, but this would do me.

The Doctor: Are you married, River?
River Song: Are you asking?
The Doctor: Yes.
River Song: ...Yes.
The Doctor: No, hang on, did you think I was asking you to marry me, or, or, or asking if you were married?
River Song: Yes.
The Doctor: No, but was that yes, or...yes.
River Song: ...Yes.
%
  I'm being extremely clever up here and there's no one to stand around looking impressed! What's the point in having
  you all?

The Doctor

The Doctor: Fellas, the guns, really? I just walked into the highest security office in the United States and parked a
big blue box on the rug. You think you can just shoot me?
River Song: They're Americans!
The Doctor: Don't shoot! Definitely no shooting.
%
Captain Avery: I'm confused.
The Doctor: Yeah, well, it's a big club. We should get T-shirts.
%
The Doctor: Is there an airport?
Amy: No.
The Doctor: A nuclear power station?
Amy: Hehe, nope.
...
The Doctor: Nearest city?
Amy: Gloucester, half an hour by car.
The Doctor: We don't have half an hour. Do we have a car?
Amy: No.
The Doctor: Well, that's good. Fantastic, that is. Twenty minutes to save the world and I've got a post office. And it's
shut.
%
The Doctor: What is that?
Amy: It's a duck pond.
The Doctor: Why aren't there any ducks?
Amy: I don't know, there are never any ducks.
The Doctor: Then how do you know it's a duck pond?

  Agatha Christie!... Oh, I love your stuff. What a mind! You fool me every time. Well, almost every time. Well, once or

Kathy Nightingale: Why did you come here anyway?
Sally Sparrow: I love old things. They make me feel sad.
Kathy Nightingale: What's good about sad?
Sally Sparrow: It's happy for deep people.
%
The Doctor: People don't understand time. It's not what you think it is.
Sally: Then what is it?
The Doctor: Complicated.
Sally: Tell me.
The Doctor: Very complicated.
Sally: I'm clever, and I'm listening, and don't patronise me because people have died and I'm not happy.
%
  Fascinating race, the Weeping Angels. The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss. They
  just zap you into the past and let you live to death... You die in the past, and in the present they consume the
  energy of all the days you might have had, all your stolen moments... They live off potential energy.

The Doctor

Amy: Have you ever run away from something because you were scared, or not ready, or just... just because you could?
The Doctor: Once. A long time ago.
Amy: What happened?
The Doctor: Hello!
%
Amy: What do we do...?
River: We're his friends; we do what the Doctor's friends always do. As we're told.
%
The Doctor: Must be a spatio-temporal hyperlink.
Mickey: What's that?
The Doctor: No idea, I just made it up. Didn't want to say "magic door".
%
Mickey: Ricky said he's London's most wanted.
Ricky: Yeah, that's not exactly...
Mickey: Not exactly what?
Ricky: I'm London's most wanted for... parking tickets.
Pete: Great.
Ricky: They were deliberate, I was fighting the system! Park anywhere, that's me.

The Doctor: Rory, take Hitler and put him in the cupboard over there, now. Do it.
Rory Williams: Right. I'm putting Hitler in the cupboard. Cupboard, Hitler.  Hitler, cupboard, c'mon.
Adolf Hitler: But I am the Führer!
Rory: Right. In you go!
%
The Doctor: Sonic cane!
Melody: Are you serious?
The Doctor: Never knowingly.
%
Rory: Doctor, River was brainwashed to kill you.
The Doctor: Well, she did. And then she used her remaining lives to bring me back. As first dates go, I’d say that was
mixed signals.
%
Alex: He's scared to death of everything.
The Doctor: Pantophobia.
Alex: What?
The Doctor: Pantophobia. Not fear of pants, though, if that's what you're thinking. It's the fear of everything.
Including pants, I suppose, in that case.
%
  You see these eyes? They're old eyes... and one thing I can tell you, Alex: Monsters are real.

The Doctor

The Doctor: Sometimes, knowing your own future is what enables you to change it.  Especially if you're bloody-minded,
contradictory, completely unpredictable...
Rory: So basically, if you're Amy, then.
The Doctor: If anyone can defeat predestiny...it's your wife.
%
  Okay, this is bad. At the moment I don’t know how bad, but certainly we're three buses, a long walk, and eight quid in
  a taxi from good.

Rita: You are a medical doctor, aren't you? You haven't just got a degree in cheese-making or something?
The Doctor: No, no. Well, yes, both, actually.

Rory: The car, too, but that's my favourite car. How did you know that was my favourite car?
The Doctor: You showed me a picture of it once and said, "That's my favourite car!"

  Right now, not very far from here, the German war machine is rolling up the map of Europe. Country after country,
  falling like dominoes. Nothing can stop it, nothing. Until one tiny, damp little island says 'No. No, not here.' A
  mouse in front of a lion. You're amazing, the lot of you. I don't know what you did to Hitler, but you frighten the
  hell out of me.

The Doctor
%
Mickey: But that's what I meant, there's no police boxes anymore so doesn't it get noticed?
The Doctor: Ricky, let me tell you something about the human race. You put a mysterious blue box slap-bang in the middle
of town, what do they do? Walk past it. Now stop your nagging. Let's go and explore.

Dalek: But you have no weapons! No defenses! No plan!
The Doctor: Yeah, and doesn't that scare you to death?

The Doctor: Give me five minutes. I'll be right back.

  Oh, and here they come. The human race. See, the end comes, as it was always going to, down a video phone.
