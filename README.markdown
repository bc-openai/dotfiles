Cool things

Thanks to [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), to install a vim plugin
just git clone / extract it into [~/.vim/bundle](https://github.com/skoh-fley/dotfiles/tree/master/.vim/bundle) and it will be autoloaded automagically.

By using git submodules instead of straight git clones, any git/github-hosted plugins
cloned into this directory will maintain links to their repos on github, avoiding having
full repos inside full repos. Check it out by visiting the directory and following the links.
